wild-dome-72/planner      | 20:47:19 PLAN_READY
wild-dome-72/planner      | 1. Add folder track command handlers in CommandHandler.h: declare `handleAddFolderTrack()`, `handleMoveTrackToFolder(params)`, `handleRemoveFromFolder(params)`
2. Implement `handleAddFolderTrack()` in CommandHandler.cpp: create FolderTrack via `edit.insertNewFolderTrack()`, return track index
3. Implement `handleMoveTrackToFolder(params)` in CommandHandler.cpp: validate track_index/folder_index, get AudioTrack and FolderTrack pointers, call `te::moveTrackTo(*audioTrack, *folderTrack)`
4. Implement `handleRemoveFromFolder(params)` in CommandHandler.cpp: validate track_index, get parent FolderTrack via `getParentFolderTrack()`, move to top level using `te::moveTrackTo(*audioTrack, nullptr)`
5. Update `handleGetTracks()` in CommandHandler.cpp: add `parent_folder` field (index or null), `is_folder` boolean, `children` array (indices) for all tracks
6. Update `handleSoloTrack()` in CommandHandler.cpp: detect FolderTrack via dynamic_cast, if folder, iterate `getAllSubTracks(false)` and solo each child
7. Update `handleMuteTrack()` in CommandHandler.cpp: detect FolderTrack via dynamic_cast, if folder, iterate `getAllSubTracks(false)` and mute each child
8. Add command dispatch in `handleCommand()` at CommandHandler.cpp:87: register "add_folder_track", "move_track_to_folder", "remove_from_folder" actions
9. Update TimelineComponent.h: add member `std::map<te::Track*, bool> folderExpandedState`, add method `bool isFolderExpanded(te::FolderTrack*)`, `void toggleFolderExpanded(te::FolderTrack*)`
10. Update `rebuildTracks()` in TimelineComponent.cpp: iterate `edit.getTrackList()` instead of just AudioTracks, build hierarchy, skip child tracks if parent folder is collapsed, use indentation for children
11. Create FolderTrackLaneComponent.h/.cpp: similar to TrackLaneComponent but displays folder header with disclosure triangle, VCA fader, solo/mute buttons
12. Update TimelineComponent.cpp: instantiate FolderTrackLaneComponent for FolderTrack instances, TrackLaneComponent for AudioTrack instances
13. Implement disclosure triangle click handler in FolderTrackLaneComponent: toggle `folderExpandedState`, call `rebuildTracks()` to refresh
14. Update MixerChannelStrip.h: add enum `StripType { Track, Folder, Master }`, add `StripType stripType` member, add constructor for FolderTrack
15. Implement FolderTrack constructor in MixerChannelStrip.cpp: set stripType=Folder, setup controls with folder-specific styling (wider strip, different bg colour from palette)
16. Update `setupControls()` in MixerChannelStrip.cpp: apply visual differences for folder strips (e.g., hide arm/input for folders, use palette->folderTrackBg or similar)
17. Update `rebuildStrips()` in MixerComponent.cpp: iterate all tracks including folders, instantiate appropriate strip type, add visual separators between folder groups
18. Update solo/mute button handlers in MixerChannelStrip.cpp: detect folder type, apply group logic (iterate children via `getAllSubTracks()`)
19. Add folder-specific palette colour in WaiveColours.h: add `folderTrackBg` to ColorPalette struct
20. Build project: `cmake -B build && cmake --build build --target Waive -j$(($(nproc)/2))`
21. Run tests: `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` to verify no regressions

wild-dome-72/validator-code |     "WHAT: getTrackById() at line 1708 uses te::getAudioTracks(edit) which excludes FolderTrack instances. HOW: All commands using getTrackById (set_track_volume, set_track_pan, arm_track, etc.) fail when track_id refers to a folder. handleSoloTrack/handleMuteTrack work around this by duplicating track lookup logic (lines 940-953, 989-1002), but other commands like set_track_volume, insert_audio_clip, duplicate_track, bounce_track, and 15+ others will fail for folder tracks. WHY: Violates DRY principle and creates inconsistent behavior - some commands handle folders, most don't. Must fix getTrackById to support both AudioTrack and FolderTrack, OR create separate helpers and update all callers.",
wild-dome-72/validator-code |     "WHAT: New commands registered (add_folder_track, move_track_to_folder, remove_from_folder) but getTrackById helper excludes FolderTrack. HOW: Commands like set_track_volume (line 223), set_track_pan (line 249), insert_audio_clip (line 275), etc. all use getTrackById which returns AudioTrack* only. If user calls set_track_volume with a folder track_id, returns null → error. handleSoloTrack/handleMuteTrack bypass this by manually iterating edit.getTrackList() with dynamic_cast checks (lines 940-953, 989-1002). WHY: Generalization check FAIL - worker fixed solo/mute for folders but left 20+ other commands broken. All getTrackById call sites must be audited and fixed."
